Have you ever been to the Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague?  It's unique in that it's actually multiple cemeteries stacked on top of one another.  Every time the land of the dead's population becomes too large to fill the space, they just add another layer.  A literal tower of corpses.

I recently found out that cities are like this, too.
	
There's an abandoned minimall here in my town that closed down a couple years ago.  One day I was passing by it and thought it might be cool to go inside, you know, find out what had become of the interior.  I doubted there was much interesting in there anymore, but I'm an explorer at heart.

After going around the perimeter, I found an unlocked door in the back and went inside.  This led into a clothing store, which was mostly vacant but still had some shelves and mannequins sitting around.  I can only imagine they left the mannequins in order to make it creepier for anyone exploring the place.  
	
The other shops were the same: mostly or entirely empty, little to see or do.  There wasn't even any graffiti or anything.  But what was I expecting, really?  To find a portal to a magical fantasy land?  It's a minimall in the middle of a small city, not an abandoned theme park or something like that.  Everybody knows *that's* where the portals are.
	
I did find something just as weird, though.  As I was heading back toward the shop I came in through, I saw an open door that I hadn't seen before.  Behind it was a staircase leading down.  I figured it must just lead to the boiler or something, but since I was here, why not explore the whole place?
	
The stairs went a lot farther down than I expected.  I'd probably descended five floors or more before I finally reached the bottom.  
	
What was down there wasn't what I expected.  It wasn't just storage or anything like that; the lower level contained more stores, in fact a lot more.  And for some reason, none of these stores had ever been cleaned out.  
	
I looked around a bit.  There was a jewelry store, a kids' clothing store...I stopped in front of one that I recognized.  It was a Warner Brothers Studio Store.  Have you ever seen one?  It was a store from the 90's that sold Warner Brothers merchandise.  I remember there was one upstairs when I was a kid, and it always looked so awesome.  They even had a giant statue of Bugs Bunny out front. 
	
The same statue I was looking at right now.
	
I remember looking it up at one point a few years back, and learned that the chain had gone out of business in 2001.  What was this, then?  Had they moved everything from the upstairs store into the basement?  No, this wasn't just a matter of some things being moved.  The storefront, the interior of the store—it was all exactly as I remembered it.  Something seriously weird was going on.
	
I went around the corner, and once again saw something that made me stop.  In front of me was an arcade.  I could never forget what that arcade looked like, because I'd been there all the time as a kid.  It had been right around the corner from the Warner Brothers Studio Store.  
	
I felt a chill run through my body.  What was going on?  Had I wandered into an episode of the Twilight Zone?  At any moment, I expected Rod Serling's voice to start narrating the events.  
	
I'll admit, I thought about turning around and going right back up those stairs.  I was seriously turned off by the weirdness of all this.  But at the same time, I was *intrigued.*  I knew I had stumbled across something incredible, and if I were willing to shake off my fears and go forward, I could learn more about it.
	
The more I explored, the more I was able to confirm that the “downstairs” mall was literally the “upstairs” mall, except from a previous point in time.  Remember the cemetery comparison?  I was walking among the corpses of former stores.  If the mall was ever demolished completely, I have no doubt another floor would be added on top of this one.  
	
Speaking of other floors, I did find another staircase on that level.  Before descending, however, I thought I should check out the mall's front entrance.  Would I find a whole underground city on the other side?  This was the question I was most excited to have answered.
	
Unfortunately, the answer I got was a little disappointing.  Turns out, on the other side of the mall's entryway door, what I found was...nothing.  Not just nothing, but *nothing.*  Beyond that door stood a sheet of solid black.  And not only could I see, but I could feel—in my mind and in my body—that this darkness wasn't the kind that comes from a lack of light.  It was the kind that comes from the lack of existence. 
	
The second staircase I found led to a level with far less shops.  I think most of the shops in the first basement level were the originals, the ones that opened along with the mall.  They had only ever been replaced once.  The second basement level had shops that had been replaced twice, of which there weren't nearly as many.  At least, that was my reasoning.  And it's worth noting by that reasoning, the third level should have been the bottom, since there was never a building in that spot before the mall went in.
	
Why, then, did I find another staircase?
	
The fourth level isn't like the others.  Not at all.  It's a maze of dimly lit corridors with occasional rooms branching off; some of these rooms are accessible, while others are locked.  Those that I can enter are cluttered with random items.  In one I found several computer monitors, with nothing to hook them up to.  Another had an assortment of power tools, torn up books, broken dishes, and a sewing machine.  There's no rhyme or reason to any of it. 
	
Down here, things don't behave like they're supposed to.  Sound, for example: whenever I place my foot down, the sound doesn't occur until seconds later—or sometimes not at all.  It's the same if I pound my fist against a door, or drop something on the ground.  And whenever the sounds do arrive, they're always wrong in some way.  Too quiet, or too loud.  Too low or high-pitched.  
	
Did you notice that I switched my story to the present tense?  That's right, I'm down here right now.  Not by choice, but because the staircase is gone.  I know I went back to the right place, but it just...isn't there.  I'm thinking—hoping—that things in this place move around, but that they don't ever disappear.  That would mean the staircase is just somewhere else now, and all I've gotta do is find it.  Simple, right?  Yeah, simple...is that why it's already been an entire day? 
	
That's what my phone says, anyway.  Oh, yeah—it seems that as long as I'm down here, my phone's battery will never run out.  I've also got internet access, but I haven't been able to call anyone.  	
	
I'd probably better get off so I can keep looking.  My phone may be able to live forever down here, but I'm starting to get hungry.  And thirsty.  And tired. 
	
Maybe I should just get to the point, the reason why I'm writing all this.  It's a simple warning: don't ever go exploring beneath your city.  If you do, you'll just end up fucked.
